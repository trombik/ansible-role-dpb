# ansible-role-dpb

Creates `chroot` for bulk package build and configures `dpb` build environment.

At the initial play, the ports tree is updated to the latest in a tag. It is
user's responsibility to update the tree afterwards. A handler is provided to
update the ports tree in host and sync files in `chroot`.

`cvs(1)` is used in the role to retrieve and update the ports tree. However, it
is subject to change in the future, and other version management might be used.

# Requirements

# Role Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `dpb_build_user` | build user | `_pbuild` |
| `dpb_build_group` | build group | `{{ dpb_build_user }}` |
| `dpb_fetch_user` | fetch user | `_pfetch` |
| `dpb_fetch_group` | fetch group | `{{ dpb_fetch_user }}` |
| `dpb_conf_dir` | path to directory to keep configuration files | `/etc/dpb` |
| `dpb_conf_file` | files that contains a list of packages to build | `{{ dpb_conf_dir }}/packages` |
| `dpb_cache_directory` | path to cache directory where sets and ports file are kept | `/var/cache/dpb` |
| `dpb_sets` | list of necessary sets | `["comp", "xbase", "xfont", "xshare"]` |
| `dpb_ftp_mirror_url_base` | string of `scheme://` + `hostname` | `http://ftp.openbsd.org` |
| `dpb_ftp_mirror_url_path` | path to the mirror root directory | `/pub/OpenBSD` |
| `dpb_signify_key_dir` | path to directory where public keys are kept | `/etc/signify` |
| `dpb_cvsroot` | mandatory `CVSROOT` string | `""` |
| `dpb_cvs_tag` | optional CVS tag. when empty, appropriate default will be set (`OPENBSD_6_0` if the release version is 6.0) | `""` |
| `dpb_proot_conf_file` | path to configuration file of `proot` | `{{ dpb_conf_dir }}/proot.conf` |
| `dpb_proot_chroot` | mandatory path to `chroot(2)` directory | `""` |
| `dpb_proot_config` | dict of `proot` configuration | see below |
| `dpb_remove_nodev_mount_option` | if `true` value is set and the mount point of `dpb_proot_chroot` is mounted with `nodev`, remove `nodev` mount option | `no` |

## `dpb_proot_config`

This is a dict for `proot`. Each key is described in
[`proot(1)`](http://man.openbsd.org/proot) man page.

Values are string except `actions` and `mkconf_lines`.

`actions` is a list of actions.

`mkconf_lines` is a list of lines to be added to `mk.conf` in `chroot`.

```yaml
dpb_proot_config:
  chroot: "{{ dpb_proot_chroot }}"
  BUILD_USER: "{{ dpb_build_user }}"
  FETCH_USER: "{{ dpb_fetch_user }}"
  chown_all: 1
  actions:
    - unpopulate_light
    - resolve
    - copy_ports
  mkconf_tail: /dev/null
```

Do not omit `mkconf_tail` when `mkconf_lines` is set. `proot` has a bug and
`mk.conf` will not be created under certain conditions. See comments in Example
Playbook. Set the variable to `/dev/null` even when you do not use it just in
case.

## `dpb_proot_chroot` and `dpb_remove_nodev_mount_option`

It is generally, and strongly, recommended to provide a dedicated partition for
`dpb_proot_chroot` without `nodev` option and to set
`dpb_remove_nodev_mount_option` to `no`, which is the default (the chroot needs
device nodes).

When `dpb_remove_nodev_mount_option` is set to `yes` and the mount point of
`dpb_proot_chroot` is mounted with `nodev`, the partition will be re-mounted
without `nodev` and `fstab(5)` will be modified. This affects all the
sub-directories of the mount point.
